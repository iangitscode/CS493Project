so what comes over here on matrix multiplication and before i get started with this example i want to talk about the sizes of each matrix because not every matrix can be multiplied by another matrix so let's take a look at the size of this first matrix in this first major we have one too rose and we have one two three columns so this first matrix is a two by three major too rose by three columns and if you take a look at the second major from multiply we have one two three rose and we have one two three columns so the second matrix is a three by three matrix so in order to multiply to major seized again are the columns in the first matrix must equal the rose in the second major so another words these two inside numbers must be the same so it's really important to check this before you multiply matrices if these two inside numbers are not the same you can not multiply the two major cities so as to make sure that your inside numbers are the same then you can take a look at your outside numbers in old joseph arrows the point to the outside numbers and the outside numbers will always give you the size of the new matrix after you're done multiplying so since the outside numbers are a two and three we know the size of the new matrix afterward than multiplying is going to be a two by three major so let us get started right away with this example so basically what we're doing when we multiplied two major cities is multiplying the rows of the first major by the columns of the second major costs so i'm gonna put a box around the first round of the first matrix and under the put another box around the first column of the second major and just make things a little easier to see where we multiply haven't circle the first number in the rolling green and i was certainly the first number in the column in green and unreserved or the second number in the row in black and on the circle the second number in the column in black and on the circle the third number and the rope in red and i'm a circle also the third number in the column in red so now we multiply the first row by the first column we can multiply the green numbers together which is to times three times three six then we can modify the black numbers together three times one which is just positive three and we must apply the red numbers together one times too is just positive to snow have multiplied the first round by the first column and now i want to do the exact same thing with the first row and the second column in the first row is still boxed from earlier and i put another box around the second column and once again i'm gonna circle the first number in green the second number and black and the third number in red and if you multiply the green numbers together we get to terms for which is eight female pilot black numbers together we get three times one which is just positive three four multiplied a red numbers together we get one times one which is just positive one and now we have multiplied the first row by the second com and now you to do the same thing all over again not gonna do the first row by the third column the first robot is already box from before an open a box around the third column once again with a circle the first numbers in green the second umbrellas in black and their numbers in red and if you multiply the green numbers we get two times five which is just ten and if you multiply the black numbers we get three times for which is just positive twelve and if we must apply the red numbers we get one tonnes for which is just positive for so now we have multiplied ro one of the first matrix by every single column of the second matrix so now we need to do the exact same thing with the second row of the first major silver box around the second row and we need a multiply that second row with every column of the second major costs so long a start with the first column and i put a box around it and once again with a circle the first numbers in green the second numbers in black and the third numbers and read anything more replied agree numbers together we have two times
