1. Review
=========

Progress
--------

We researched on existing technologies that we could use for speech-to-text translaion. 
Our preliminary research revealed Amazon AWS would be a good use case to integrate with our project.
This was done together as a group.

Blockers + Suprises
-------------------

Our biggest blocker was idea formulation and finding a problem to solve.
We spent a couple of days brainstorming on various ideas.
Eventually, we narrowed our idea based on the target demographics and the platform on which we wanted to develop our software on.
We decided that we wanted our product to benefit end users. This also meant that our focus would most probably be something web-based.
Finally, we came up with a common problem that we all faced, and decided that we would like to develop a solution for this.

One of the main reasons that convinced us this idea would be worth pursuing was that although we found similar software for our problem,
none were able to do exactly what we wanted. This gave us confidence that other people also had similar problems and there was demand for a solution;
however, we also felt that we were able to provide something unique which gave us some excitement in developing something novel.


2. Learning Activity
====================

In this week we mainly discussed the main idea of the project -- what it would do, who our end users were, and how we could build it.

We went with Activity 4.1 -- Modes of Creative Thinking: Intense and Casual. For this activity, each of us decided to immerse in a particular 
problem domain by thinking of problems that we faced in our daily lives. We figured that if there exists a problem that affected us, it would compel
us to "scratch the itch" by building something to solve it. Here is a brief summary of the problems we brainstormed, individually:

Mohammad: Wanted a platform that could seamlessly sync his apps between mobile and PC. For instance, have the ability to open an app like Instagram on
his phone but be able to browse it on his PC.

Ian: Wanted a tool that could filter out unnecessary news across his social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter etc). The filter would be based on individual
preferences or can be customized dynamically.

Zach: Wanted a software / website that allowed him to share his screen with friends as well as stream his PC audio. Wanted this to be able to watch movies
with friends together, remotely.

In the end, we either found existing solutions to our problems, or our proposed solutions were not feasible for us to build in a short timesspan, or simply 
realized that it was not huge enough of a problem that we wanted to build something to fix it. However, after some time mulling over it, we found a 
common problem -- since all of us were completing the school term online, we encountered the problem of having to re-watch long online videos to revisit a
particular section that we forgot the timestamp of. This gave rise to the idea of building a web tool to solve this problem.


3. Plan
=======

"Plans are worthless, but planning is everything."

Project goals for the next three weeks:

1. Finalizing the technologies to use
2. Understanding the problem we are trying to solve exactly
3. A general idea of how this would be implemented

Learning activities for the next three weeks:

1. 
2. 
3. 

Goals for the end of the term:

1. Have a working version of the software
2. Learning how to build projects with attention to project planning and scoping our requirements
3. Have the software be tried out / tested by users

Results to be attained for Symposium Day March 2021:

A working prototype that has been used and tested by people
